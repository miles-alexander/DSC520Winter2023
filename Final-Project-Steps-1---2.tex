\section{Step 1:}\label{step-1}

\subsection{Introduction:}\label{introduction}

Throughout the years, the United States of America has seen an increase
in violence through mass shootings. Since the Sandy Hook Elementary
School shooting, we have seen the numbers nearly triple in size. While,
yes, the country should look at better gun control policies to solve
this issue, as data scientists we can look at the data that we have
collected from these shootings over the past 10 years to try to prevent
these from happening in the future. We can look at different factors
such as demographics, socioeconomic status, and the effect that mental
illness can have on these shootings. This is important for individuals
to be interested in because it is something that can potentially help
reduce the number of shootings or hopefully eradicate them completely at
some point in the future. With the amount of data that has been compiled
since this great increase 10 years ago, it can now be a problem
addressed through the help of data science.

\subsection{Research Questions:}\label{research-questions}

1.~~~~ What is the choice of weapon for these shootings?

2.~~~~ Do the shooters have a criminal background or are they first time
offenders?

3.~~~~ Which gender is more prone to commit this type of crime?

4.~~~~ Where do most shootings take place? What is the most frequent
place?

5.~~~~ Does race play a role in mass shootings?

6.~~~~ Does mental illness play a role in mass shootings?

\subsection{Approach:}\label{approach}

This approach will not fully address the problem but rather will serve
as a means of attempting to predict criminal behavior based on past
experiences. By gathering and compiling the data of previous mass
shootings, we will aim to create a guide of what to look for or what to
flag as suspicious activity. This will assist with helping to provide
enough police presence in areas that are more prone to attacks. It will
help create a log for legally obtained weapons and who purchased them in
order to better track these. The biggest thing this approach will aim to
accomplish is determine the correlation (or lack thereof) between mass
shootings and individuals with mental illness in order to persuade and
implement a program of mental health evaluation prior to firearm sales.

\subsection{Data:}\label{data}

1.~~~~
\url{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zusmani/us-mass-shootings-last-50-years}

This dataset looks at mass shooting attacks in the United States of
America between 1966 and 2017. The dataset contains Serial No, Title,
Location, Date, Summary, Fatalities, Injured, Total Victims, Mental
Health Issue, Race, Gender, and Latitude and Longitude information. The
data set was posted to Kaggle in 2022 and has been modified multiple
times to add new variables, add new data, and add missing data in order
to help create visualizations and extract patterns. Similar to my
project, the data set aims to aid in predictions for future events and
prevention of such.

2.~~~~ \url{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlosparadis/stanford-msa}

This dataset attempts to facilitate research on gun violence in the US
by making raw data more accessible. This dataset is comparable to the
previous one except it has a bit more detail in the mental illness
variable which can be very useful with the project.

3.~~~~
\url{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/twinkle0705/mental-health-and-suicide-rates}

The goal of using this dataset is to determine if a correlation exists
between mental health and suicide rates. The majority of mass shootings
end with the perpetrator being shot down by the police. Because of this,
it stands to reason that mass shooters go into the situation not
expecting to come out alive (i.e.~go in as a suicide attempt while
taking people out with them). This dataset compares countries, their
resources for mental health, their mental health facilities as well as
their suicide rates.

\subsection{Required Packages:}\label{required-packages}

From what I know so far, the packages required to load and compare these
datasets are as follows:

library(ggplot2)

library(dplyr)

library(readr)

library(tidyr)

library(stringr)

library(reshape2)

library(ggthemes)

library(lattice)

library(knitr)

\subsection{Plots and Table Needs:}\label{plots-and-table-needs}

Scatterplots, histograms, and boxplots. I would also like to incorporate
a map graph to depict the rates per state and an area chart to show the
change over time of mass shootings. As far as tables go, I would like to
use the simple XY table as well as column tables and grouped table to go
a bit more in depth for comparison purposes. A multiple variables table
might also prove to be beneficial for displaying data and making it
easier to understand for the reader.

\subsection{Questions for Future
Steps:}\label{questions-for-future-steps}

The main thing that I do not right now that I will need in order to
analyze and interpret the data is how to create the correct tables and
plots as described above. I am sure that there will need to be other
things to learn but right now, I do not know that that is. For the most
part, I feel confident in the datasets I have collected as well as with
the learnings we have covered so far to be able to compare the datasets
and come to a conclusion that could possibly assist with predicting the
who, what, where, how, and why of mass shootings in the United States.

\section{Step 2:}\label{step-2}

\subsection{How did you import and clean your
data?}\label{how-did-you-import-and-clean-your-data}

Data cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and incorrect
data. Missing values can be handled by either dropping the rows/columns
with missing values. For my dataset, I used na.omit() in order to remove
any empty cells that would not give accurate information for the study.
I also cleaned up and corrected the date format on all of the entries as
they were not all the same.

Within minutes, Perez was fatally wounded in a shootout with law enforcement officers responding to the scene.
## 43 Travis Reinking, 29, opened fire around 3:30 a.m. in the parking lot of a Waffle House in Antioch, and continued shooting as he entered the restaurant. As he attempted to reload his AR-15, a bystander heroically wrestled the rifle away from Reinking, who then fled; he was captured by authorities the following day. Reinking had a history of erratic behavior and run-ins with law enforcement in his home state of Illinois, including claims that he was being stalked and harassed by pop star Taylor Swift. In July 2017, he was arrested at the White House after breaching security in an effort to speak with President Trump, reportedly claiming his right to do so as â€œa sovereign citizen.â€

\subsection{What information is not
self-evident?}\label{what-information-is-not-self-evident}

The information that is not self-evident will be the relationship
between the variables. In order to uncover new information in the data,
I plan to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) involving visualizing
the data using plots, finding correlations, and identifying patterns and
trends in the data. There are also two questions for which I may need to
do my own research for and add columns to represent this such as
previous criminal history as well as generalized location of where they
shooting took place.

\subsection{What are different ways you could look at this
data?}\label{what-are-different-ways-you-could-look-at-this-data}

By performing descriptive statistics to get a sense of the distribution
of each variable, or by creating visualizations like histograms or
scatter plots to understand the relationships between variables.

\subsection{How do you plan to slice and dice the
data?}\label{how-do-you-plan-to-slice-and-dice-the-data}

I plan to explore the data by grouping it based on variables or possibly
filtering to focus on a subset. The groupby() function that we used
previously I feel may come in handy for this assignment. It is important
to look at the data for each variable as each variable will play a key
role in answering the questions of this study.

\subsection{How could you summarize your data to answer key
questions?}\label{how-could-you-summarize-your-data-to-answer-key-questions}

In order to summarize the data, I plan on calculating measures of
central tendency like the mean, median and mode as well as measures of
dispersion like the standard deviation or interquartile range.

\subsection{What types of plots and tables will help you to illustrate
the findings to your
questions?}\label{what-types-of-plots-and-tables-will-help-you-to-illustrate-the-findings-to-your-questions}

I will use bar graphs, box plots, histograms, line graphs and scatter
plots to illustrate my findings. I am still unsure of which
visualization will work best for the dataset and the data manipulation I
perform but I intend to experiement until I find whatever best explains
the point I am trying to get accross. Correlation matrices will also aid
in demonstrating relationships between variables.

\subsection{Do you plan on incorporating any machine learning techniques
to answer your research questions?
Explain.}\label{do-you-plan-on-incorporating-any-machine-learning-techniques-to-answer-your-research-questions-explain.}

Since my research questions involve finding patterns in the data, I will
be incorporating machine learning techniques to answer these. I again I
am unsure if this will work or help with what I am trying to do but I
aim to use regression models for now and depending on research and knew
knowledge within the course, I may incorporate other techniques as well.

\subsection{What questions do you have now, that will lead to further
analysis or additional
steps?}\label{what-questions-do-you-have-now-that-will-lead-to-further-analysis-or-additional-steps}

The questions that I have at this point are mostly pertaining to which
of the methods, techniques, and/or concepts that we have covered thus
far could work for this project. For all previous assignments, we have
been given the data and what to do with it so now having to determine
which to use is overwhelming. As far as the data goes, my questions are
solely in relation to the correlation of variables as well as attempting
to find the appropriate answers to the questions I presented in part 1.

\section{Step 3:}\label{step-3}

\subsection{Introduction:}\label{introduction-1}

Year by year, the amount of violence through mass shooting in America
has drastically increased with numbers tripling in size since the Sandy
Hook Elementary School shooting back in 2012. In combination with my
bachelor degree in Criminal Justice, I aim to use what I have learned so
far in my data science degree to look at data that has been collected on
this subject and try to make sense of it so as to try and prevent future
violent events from happening or at least be more prepared for if they
do happen. We can look at different factors such as demographics,
socioeconomic status, and the effect that mental illness can have on
these shootings. I believe that this is an important subject and that
with the help of data science we can try to better understand the
underlying factors that play into mass shootings and hope that we can
get ahead of it and be better at handling them and responding to them
while we get to the point of preventing them altogether.

\subsection{The problem statement you
addressed.}\label{the-problem-statement-you-addressed.}

The problem statement that this project aimed to address was mostly an
attempt of analyzing data that we already had from previous instances in
order to look for patterns in the data that can in some way assist us
with the prevention of future violent events or possibly assist with
creating a presentation to assist with making a convincing argument for
better gun legislation. By looking at specific parts of the dataset such
as the weapon type, gender, location, race and mental health all
assisted with making a conclusion to answer the questions we originally
presented in part 1.

\subsection{How you addressed this problem
statement?}\label{how-you-addressed-this-problem-statement}

As mentioned above, in order to address the problems presented in part
1, I took a look at each variable in the dataset that had anything to do
with the questions that were asked. I used ``dplyr'' in order to count
the number of occurrences in a column to get a good idea of which value
appeared most often for each column. I also created bar graphs for each
in order to visualize what the data is doing.

Upon trying to work with the data for weapon type, I came to the
realization that the inputs for this column are all over the place
making it impossible to work with without cleaning it up in depth. There
are also some cases in which more than one weapon was used and I am
unsure of how to separate these and account for them or how to analyze
it. This is definitely something that I need more work on in order to
better understand this particular column of data.

\textbf{Question 2: Do the shooters have a criminal background or are
they first time offenders?}

This unfortunately is another one that I do not have enough data to
answer. The datasets that I chose do not have enough information to
determine wehter or not the attacker was a repeat or first time
offender.

crime?}

This was one of my favorite variables to work with mainly because it
helped me gain some confidence after being unable to answer the first
two questions of my project. The answer for this question was a pretty
obvious one for me going into the project but I wanted to make sure that
the data spoke for itself. It is clear that the male gender is more
prone to committing these types of crimes than any other.

\textbf{Question 4: Where do most shootings take place? What is the most
frequent place?}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{Final-Project-Steps-1---2_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-9-1.pdf}

The location variable helped to an extent. I did think it was a bit
vague in having the Other variable rather than being more specific but
that is a limitation I just had to work around. Not including the
``Other'' category, the workplace and school are the two top locations
for where mass shootings take place and this can be accounted to
disgruntled employees or students both current and past.

\textbf{Question 5: Does race play a role in mass shootings?}

\begin{Shaded}

White individuals are much more likely to be involved with and commit
violent mass shootings as opposed to any other race.

\textbf{Question 6: Does mental illness play a role in mass shootings?}

\begin{Shaded}

\includegraphics{Final-Project-Steps-1---2_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-13-1.pdf}

This variable is missing some data for some of the attackers. However,
the majority of the answers (for those that we have data for) were that
yes they indeed showed signs of mental health issues prior to the
attack. I think that this variable could be filled out better if the law
enforcement that was in charge of the case looked to ask these questions
upon interviewing the attacker's friends and families after the fact. I
know that this is not a guarantee that a mental illness is present but
it is the best indication that we currently have since we cannot alwasy
perform a mental evaluation on the attackers as most of these end up
dead either by suicide or by cop.

\subsection{Implications}\label{implications}

The implications provided upon answering the questions from part 1 are
that there are in fact, some individuals that are more prone to
committing crimes such as violent mass shootings. The project concludes
that white individuals with prior signs of mental illness and of the
male gender are typically those that are more prone to this type of
crime and will more often than not, do it at their current or previous
place of employment or education. While we cannot have every single
individual that falls under these categories under surveillance 24/7 on
the assumption that they will go on a shooting spree, we can try to
provide better mental health facilities and resources and remove the
stigma surrounding it particularly for white men. Of course, we cannot
force everyone to talk about their problems but it zeroes in on the
demographic that might require it the most in order to attempt to
resolve the larger issue at hand. The mental health issue can and should
also be addressed upon attempting to purchase a weapon in order to
ensure that the individual is fit to own and operate one responsibly.
This is not only for the safety of others but also for the safety of the
individual who may be suffering from a mental break.

\subsection{Limitations}\label{limitations}

Similar to what was already described above, the limitations for this
project lie in the fact that there is much more information about the
attacker that can be helpful to further narrow down the patterns. The
limitation in resolving the issue also lies in the fact that one of the
biggest issues we are seeing with mass shooters is that they are
suffering from some type of mental illness. However, and I always say
this, you can't help someone that doesn't want to be helped and so
regardless of how many initiatives, facilities, or resources we put in
place to assist with mental wellness, not everyone that needs it will
reach out and seek the help. America as whole has put this stigma on
men's mental health and thus they are less likely to seek out
professionals to assist them with their issues, to talk about them, and
work through them.

\subsection{Concluding Remarks}\label{concluding-remarks}

While this project is essentially just the tip of the iceberg, I would
love to continue working with the dataset in the future once I know much
more than I do now. I do believe that data science can help with this
issue however, I still need to learn so much more to manipulate the
dataset to show me how to help. Again, I know that this will never be a
perfect method for determining who as an individual will become a mass
shooter, but I think it could be useful for data scientists and law
enforcement to study to learn patterns and better help the communities
that they serve.
