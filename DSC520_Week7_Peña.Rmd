  geom_smooth(method = lm) + labs(x = "Time TV", y = "Happiness")

print(tvVsHappySlope)

# I used geom_smooth in order to create a best line for the plots since there 
# was no clear line to follow (except for on the TimeReading vs TimeTV plot). 
# Based on these graphs, the slopes for TimeReading vs. TimeTv and for 
# TimeReading vs. Happiness have a negative relationship and the slope for 
# TimeTv vs. Happiness has a positive relationship. However, when looking at the 
# original plots, TimeReading vs. TimeTV still has a negative relationship, 
# TimeReading vs. Happiness has no clear pattern and thus their relationship is 
# weak/non-existent, and the TimeTV vs. Happiness is still, for the most part, 
# a positive relationship.

```

# Create a covariance matrix

``` {r}

cov(studentSurvey[, c(1:3)])

# Looking at the covariance matrix, we can see that the relationship between 
# TimeReading and TimeTV is represented by a negative value meaning that as one 
# variable increases, the other value tends to decrease (the same thing the plot 
# showed us). The relationship between TimeReading and Happiness is also 
# represented by a negative value. The relationship between TimeTv and Happiness 
# is represented by a positive value meaning that the two variables tend to 
# increase or decrease sequentially. 

```

# Create a correlation matrix

``` {r}

cor(studentSurvey[, c(1:3)])

# The correlation matrix can be expressed as a range of values expressed within 
# the interval [-1, 1]. The value -1 indicates a perfect non-linear (negative) 
# relationship, 1 is a perfect positive linear relationship and 0 is an 
# intermediate between neither positive nor negative linear interdependency. 
# Based on the numbers we get, the relationships all remain the same. 
# TimeReading vs. TimeTV is a negative relationship. TimeReading vs. Happiness 
# is also a negative relationship. TimeTV vs. Happiness is a positive 
# relationship. In my opinion, it is easier to interpret the relationships 
# between the variables by using the correlation matrix as the numbers are 
# smaller and can be interpreted more simply. For example, while TimeReading vs. 
# TimeTV have a negative relationship, it is not a perfect non-linear (negative) 
# relationship since it is not a -1 but we can determine how close to -1 it is. 
# The same goes for the other relationships. 

```

# Correlation Test

``` {r}

cor.test(studentSurvey$TimeReading, studentSurvey$TimeTV)

# The p-value of the test is 0.0003153, which is less than the significance 
# level alpha = 0.05. We can conclude that TimeReading and TimeTV are 
# significantly correlated with a correlation coefficient of -0.88 and p-value 
# of 0.0003153. The more time that one spends reading the less time that they 
# will spend watching TV.
